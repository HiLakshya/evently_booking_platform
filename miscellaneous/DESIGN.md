# üèóÔ∏è System Design ‚Äì Evently Booking Platform

This document describes the **architecture, design principles, and data modeling** for Evently.

---

## üéØ Design Principles

- **Concurrency Safety** ‚Äì Optimistic locking, row-level transactions, Redis locks.
- **Scalability** ‚Äì Horizontal scaling with load balancers + DB connection pooling.
- **Performance** ‚Äì Redis caching, async operations, efficient indexing.
- **Reliability** ‚Äì Circuit breakers, retry strategies, background task queues.
- **Separation of Concerns** ‚Äì Clear modular structure (users, bookings, events, analytics).

## üîÑ Concurrency Control Strategy

1. **Database-level**

   - Row-level locking on event capacity.
   - Optimistic locking (version fields).
   - Serializable transactions for critical updates.

2. **Application-level**

   - Redis distributed locks for seat holds.
   - Async request handling for non-blocking I/O.
   - Circuit breakers for external services.

3. **Booking flow**

   - Temporary seat holds with TTL.
   - Atomic booking operations.
   - Compensation for failed transactions.

## üóÇÔ∏è Core Services

- **Event Service** ‚Üí CRUD for events, search, filtering, capacity.
- **Booking Service** ‚Üí Create/cancel bookings, manage waitlist, concurrency safety.
- **User Service** ‚Üí Registration, login (JWT), profiles.
- **Analytics Service** ‚Üí Reports, dashboards, advanced trends.
- **Notification Service** ‚Üí Emails for bookings, cancellations, waitlist spots.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling Strategy

- **Concurrency Errors** ‚Üí Retry with exponential backoff.
- **Business Logic Errors** ‚Üí Validation errors with descriptive messages.
- **System Errors** ‚Üí Circuit breakers, fallback responses.
- **Rate Limiting** ‚Üí Headers `X-RateLimit-*`.

---

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

**Metrics tracked**

- Booking success rate, cancellation rate, revenue.
- Response times (p50, p95, p99).
- Database connection pool health.
- Cache hit/miss ratios.

**Alerting**

- Critical: booking failures, DB down.
- Warning: high latency, cache misses.
- Business: unusual booking patterns.

‚úÖ This design ensures **correctness, scalability, and performance** even under heavy traffic.
