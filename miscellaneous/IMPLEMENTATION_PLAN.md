# 🗺️ Implementation Plan – Evently Booking Platform

This document outlines the **step-by-step implementation plan** for building the Evently backend.  
Each stage includes key tasks and implementation milestones.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 – Project Setup

- Initialize Python project with **uv + pyproject.toml**.
- Install dependencies: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL driver, Redis, Celery.
- Add dev tools: black, mypy, pre-commit.
- Setup environment variables and `.env.example`.
- Create Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` .

---

## ✅ Phase 2 – Database & Models

- Define **SQLAlchemy models**:
  - Users
  - Events
  - Bookings
  - Seats
  - Waitlist
- Setup migrations.
- Add relationships, constraints, and indexes.
- Implement connection pooling for concurrency.

---

## ✅ Phase 3 – User Authentication

- Implement **User model** with bcrypt password hashing.
- Setup JWT-based authentication.
- Add endpoints: register, login, profile management.
- Add `is_admin` flag for role-based permissions.

---

## ✅ Phase 4 – Event Management

- Implement CRUD for events.
- Add filters: date, price, availability, venue.
- Enable **admin-only** event creation/deletion.
- Add pagination & search.

---

## ✅ Phase 5 – Seat Management

- Define Seat model with section/row/number.
- Generate seat maps for events.
- Implement seat availability checks.
- Add seat selection + temporary holds (Redis TTL).

---

## ✅ Phase 6 – Booking System

- Implement booking creation with **optimistic locking**.
- Ensure atomic capacity updates.
- Add booking cancellation with seat release.
- Implement booking expiration with background jobs.

---

## ✅ Phase 7 – Booking History & Dashboard

- Implement user booking history retrieval.
- Add booking status categories (confirmed, cancelled, expired).
- Generate receipts.
- Implement audit trail (`BookingHistory`).

---

## ✅ Phase 8 – Waitlist System

- Implement Waitlist model with **queue position tracking**.
- Allow joining/leaving waitlists.
- Notify users when seats open.
- Assign seats to waitlisted users with time-limited offers.

---

## ✅ Phase 9 – Notification Service

- Integrate Celery workers for async tasks.
- Create email templates (booking confirmation, cancellations, waitlist).
- Configure SMTP or email service provider.

---

## ✅ Phase 10 – Admin Analytics

- Implement analytics service with reports:
  - Total bookings
  - Popular events
  - Capacity utilization
  - Revenue metrics
- Add endpoints under `/api/v1/admin/analytics`.

---

## ✅ Phase 11 – Caching & Performance

- Integrate Redis for caching:
  - Event listings
  - Seat availability
  - Analytics snapshots
- Implement distributed locks for seat selection.
- Write cache invalidation logic.

---

## ✅ Phase 12 – Error Handling & Validation

- Define custom exceptions (e.g., `BookingCapacityExceededError`).
- Add global error handler with JSON responses.
- Implement retry/backoff for concurrency failures.
- Add logging and monitoring hooks.

---

## ✅ Phase 13 – Integration & Concurrency Handling

- Implement high-concurrency booking safety.
- Add Redis distributed locks for seat holds.
- Verify overselling prevention.
- Ensure capacity updates remain atomic.

---

## ✅ Phase 14 – API Documentation

- Enable **Swagger UI** and **ReDoc** via FastAPI.
- Add schema validation examples.
- Provide **Postman collection**.
- Document auth flow, error codes, rate limits.

---

## ✅ Phase 15 – Advanced Features

- **Advanced Analytics** – Trends, predictions, retention metrics.
- **Seat Recommendations** – Personalized seat suggestions.
- **Bulk Bookings** – Discounts for groups.
- **Event Recommendations** – Hybrid filtering.
- **Dynamic Pricing** – Demand-based adjustments.
- **Comprehensive Monitoring** – Health checks, metrics.

---

## ✅ Phase 16 – Testing & QA

- **Unit Tests** – services, models, utils.
- **Integration Tests** – API flows, DB operations.
- **Concurrency Tests** – simulate thousands of concurrent bookings.
- **End-to-End Tests** – user + admin workflows.
- **Load Tests** – stress testing under peak traffic.
- **Chaos Testing** – DB/cache failures, network disruptions.
