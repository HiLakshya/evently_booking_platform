**Endpoint**

```

POST /api/v1/advanced/seats/recommendations

```

Example request:

```json
{
  "event_id": "uuid",
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "quantity": 2,
  "max_price": 100.0,
  "preferred_sections": ["Orchestra", "Mezzanine"],
  "accessibility_required": false
}
```

## 👥 3. Bulk Booking Operations

**Features**

- Corporate/group bookings with discounts.
- Automatic seat assignment for large groups.
- Discount codes and group receipts.

**Discount Structure**

- 10+ tickets → 5% discount
- 20+ tickets → 10% discount
- 50+ tickets → 15% discount

**Endpoint**

```
POST /api/v1/advanced/bookings/bulk
```

Example request:

```json
{
  "event_id": "uuid",

  "quantity": 25,
  "group_name": "Corporate Event",
  "discount_code": "BULK10"
}
```

## 🎭 4. Event Recommendation System

**Features**

- **Collaborative filtering** – recommends based on similar users.
- **Content-based filtering** – matches event metadata.
- **Hybrid model** – combines both approaches.

**Recommendation Factors**

- Venue preferences
- Price patterns
- Event keywords
- Time/day preferences
- Popularity

**Endpoint**

```
POST /api/v1/advanced/events/recommendations
```

## 💰 5. Dynamic Pricing System

**Features**

- Demand-based pricing (capacity utilization).
- Time-based pricing (closer to event = higher price).
- Booking velocity (surges = price bump).
- Waitlist pressure (high demand = increased price).

**Constraints**

- Max price increase: **+50%**
- Max price decrease: **-20%**
- Minimum adjustment: **1%**

**Endpoints**

```
POST /api/v1/advanced/pricing/update/{event_id}
POST /api/v1/advanced/pricing/update-all
```

---

## 🖥️ 6. Comprehensive Monitoring

**Features**

- Database health (pool size, queries).
- Cache health (Redis ops, hit/miss ratio).
- API performance (response times, error rates).
- Booking system health (failures, stuck bookings).
- External services (email, payments).

**Endpoints**

```
GET /api/v1/advanced/health/comprehensive
GET /api/v1/advanced/health/monitoring
```

**Metrics**

- Response times (p50, p95, p99).
- Error rates by service.
- CPU/memory usage.
- Queue sizes.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

**Service Architecture**

```
API Layer (FastAPI)
  ↓
Service Layer (Business Logic)
  ↓
Data Layer (SQLAlchemy + Redis)
```

**Caching Strategy**

- Event recommendations → cached 1h
- Analytics data → cached 15m
- Health checks → cached 5m
- Seat recommendations → real-time only

**Performance**

- Async/await everywhere
- DB connection pooling
- Batch analytics processing
- Circuit breakers for external services

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

- **Slow recommendations** → check DB indexes.
- **High memory usage** → reduce analytics cache TTL.
- **Pricing not updating** → check Celery tasks.
- **Health check failing** → verify external dependencies.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Machine learning for smarter recommendations.
- A/B testing framework for pricing.
- Real-time analytics dashboards.
- User segmentation for marketing.
- Kafka-based event streaming for scalability.
